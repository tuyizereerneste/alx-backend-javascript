0x01. ES6 Promises

At the end of this project, I am expected to: 
	- Promises (how, why, and what)
	- How to use the then, resolve, catch methods
	- How to use every method of the Promise object
	- Throw / Try
	- The await operator
	- How to use an async function

TASKS:

1. Return a Promise using this prototype function getResponseFromAPI()
2. Using the prototype below, return a promise. The parameter is a boolean.
3. Fromthe file, import uploadPhoto and createUser from utils.js

Knowing that the functions in utils.js return promises, use the prototype below to collectively resolve all promises and log body firstName lastName to the console.
4. Write and export a function named uploadPhoto. It should accept one argument fileName (string).

The function should return a Promise rejecting with an Error and the string $fileName cannot be processed
